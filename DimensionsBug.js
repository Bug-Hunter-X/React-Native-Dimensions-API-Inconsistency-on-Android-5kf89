This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` methods might return incorrect or inconsistent values, particularly during app startup or after screen rotations. This can lead to layout issues, where components are rendered with the wrong size or position.
